# GitHub-Familiarization
GitHub Familiarization

Objective:  Become familiar with GitHub as an online repository for your coding work and GitHub Desktop for managing your work locally and reintegrating it with your online repository.

Task:  Accept a GitHub assignment, clone the instructor repository on your GitHub account and locally as a new personal repository, edit a file in the repository to provide a brief biography of yourself, commit the changes made to your local copy of the file, and push those changes back to your GitHub account and assignment repository. 

Note:  If you will be using your personal computer this semester, please download and install the following programs:
1.  Notepad++ - https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/
2.  PythonWin - see installation file on Canvas
3.  GitHubDesktop - https://desktop.github.com/

Step #1 - Create a GitHub Account
Login to GitHub (https://github.com) and create a free personal account.  I recommend choosing a user name that make it easy for me to recognize your identity.  GitHub will serve as your online storage for coding work this semester.  I will be able to access your class-related code, provide feedback, answer your questions, and grade your assignments.  You will also have a permanent copy of your work that you retain and control after the semester ends.

Step #2 - Start GitHub Desktop
Login to GitHub Desktop using your GitHub credentials.

Step #3 - Accept the Assignment Invitation and Clone a Template Repository
When you are assigned coding work this semester, I will send you an email message with a link.  Simply click on this link to "accept" the assignment.  This automatically starts the process of copying a template repository containing instructions and other important files that I provide as a starting point.  This procedure is also known as cloning.  The cloned respository will follow the naming convention "template repository name" - "your GitHub username". 

Step #4 - Create a Local Clone
Within GitHub, find your  newly created assignment repository, click the green Code button, and choose Open with GitHubDesktop.  GitHub Desktop gives you the option to open the locally cloned files in an editor program (e.g., Notepad++), viewing the repo files in Windows Explorer, or opening the repo page on GitHub.
