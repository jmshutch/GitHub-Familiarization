# GitHub-Familiarization
GitHub Familiarization

Objective:  Become familiar with GitHub as an online repository for your coding work and GitHub Desktop for managing your work locally and reintegrating it with your online repository.

Note:  If you will be using your personal computer this semester, please download and install the following programs:
1.  Notepad++ - https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/
2.  PythonWin - see installation file on Canvas
3.  GitHubDesktop - https://desktop.github.com/

Step #1 - Create a GitHub Account
Login to GitHub (https://github.com) and create a free personal account.  I recommend choosing a user name that make it easy for me to recognize your identity.  GitHub will serve as your online storage for coding work this semester.  I will be able to access your class-related code, provide feedback, answer your questions, and grade your assignments.  You will also have a permanent copy of your work that you retain and control after the semester ends.

Step #2 - Start GitHub Desktop
Login to GitHub Desktop using your GitHub credentials.
